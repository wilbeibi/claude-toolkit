name: newcomer-lens-review
description: |
  Code review framework from the perspective of a competent engineer who just joined the team.
  Identifies documentation gaps, missing context, undocumented constraints, and implicit assumptions
  that impede newcomer onboarding. Focuses on what a new team member needs to understand the code,
  not on style or convention.

keywords:
  - code review
  - documentation gaps
  - context
  - onboarding
  - tribal knowledge
  - design rationale

trigger_phrases:
  - "review this code as a newcomer"
  - "newcomer lens review"
  - "what would a new engineer not understand"
  - "identify context gaps"
  - "review with fresh eyes"
  - "document missing context"

usage_examples:
  - input: "review this code as a newcomer would - what context are we missing?"
    expected_behavior: "Identifies unstated assumptions, design decisions, domain concepts, and constraints that aren't self-evident from the code"
  - input: "Apply the newcomer lens to help me document this system"
    expected_behavior: "Highlights what tribal knowledge exists, what needs documentation, and what questions a new engineer would ask"
  - input: "What context gaps would prevent a newcomer from understanding this?"
    expected_behavior: "Categorizes gaps into design decisions, domain knowledge, historical context, and system constraints"

context:
  - Designed for distributed systems and complex codebases
  - Helps distinguish between standard patterns (obvious to experts) and project-specific decisions
  - Improves onboarding documentation and team knowledge transfer
  - Useful for code reviews targeting knowledge preservation, not just correctness
